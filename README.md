> Generator for generating VueJS applications.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-jm-vuejs using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-jm-vuejs
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo jm-vuejs
```

## Getting To Know Yeoman

* Yeoman has a heart of gold.

## Vue Application

This generator will help you bootstrap a vue application pretty quickly. You will have a few choices for the core boilerplate. These choices will let you decide on which additional features (besides the ones in the Vue core) you would like to use. In the following section you'll get a short summary of the functionality and the libs we use to enhance our applications.

### Core Features

The following core features are built into the generators root boilerplate.

#### Dependency Injection

This can be used to ease working with dependencies the right way. Also, this makes testing components much easier.

##### Libs

* [vue-inject](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-inject)

##### Docs / Articles

* [vue-inject Docs](https://github.com/jpex-js/vue-inject/blob/master/README.md)

---

#### Error Tracking

Error tracking with raven-js will allow you to catch most uncatched errors in a production grade frontend application.

##### Libs

* [raven-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raven-js)
* [raven-js/plugins/vue](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/blob/master/plugins/vue.js)

##### Docs / Articles

* [raven-js with Vue](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/blob/master/docs/integrations/vue.rst)

---

#### GraphQL Client

If you intend to connect your Vue application to a GraphQL backend the apollo client and vue-apollo do a great job.

##### Libs

* [apollo-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-client)
* [vue-apollo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-apollo)

##### Docs / Articles

* [vue-apollo Docs](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo)
* [vue-apollo example app](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo-example)
* ["Use Apollo in your VueJS app" - 27.09.2016](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/use-apollo-in-your-vuejs-app-89812429d8b2)

---

#### HTTP Client

For communicating with regular (and not so regular) REST APIs vue-resource is a great tool.

##### Libs

* [vue-resource](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-resource)

##### Docs / Articles

* [vue-resource Docs](https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource)

---

#### Routing

All routing needs can be fulfilled with vue-router. This is especially true because it is developed by the core team in "feature parity" together with Vue itself.

##### Libs

* [vue-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-router)

##### Docs / Articles

* [vue-router Docs](https://router.vuejs.org/en/)

---

#### State

Handling the state will quickly become a vital part of your Vue application if you intend to scale it. Vuex is (like the vue-router) developed by the core team.

##### Libs

* [vuex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuex)

##### Docs / Articles

* [vuex Docs](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/)

---

#### Translations / i18n

If you consider a lightweight i18n implementation in your applications to be a "basic feature", vue-i18n can be used without hassle.

##### Libs

* [vue-i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-i18n)

##### Docs / Articles

* [vue-i18n Docs](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/)
